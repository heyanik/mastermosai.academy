# CSS

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a powerful language that allows you to control the presentation and styling of web pages. In this beginner's guide, we'll cover the basics of CSS to help you get started.

## What is CSS?

CSS is used to define the appearance and layout of HTML elements in a web page. It provides a way to customize the colors, fonts, spacing, and other visual aspects of your web content. By separating the style from the structure, CSS allows you to create consistent and visually appealing designs across your entire website.

## How CSS Works

CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. Each rule consists of a selector and a declaration block. The selector targets the HTML element(s) you want to style, and the declaration block contains the specific styling instructions enclosed in curly braces.

Here's a simple example:

```css
p {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 16px;
}
```

In this example, the selector `p` targets all `<p>` elements, and the declaration block sets the text color to blue and the font size to 16 pixels.

## CSS Selectors

- CSS offers various selectors to target specific elements or groups of elements. Here are a few commonly used selectors:

- Element Selector: Targets specific HTML elements, such as `p`, `h1`, or `div`.
- Class Selector: Targets elements with a specific class attribute, using the `.classname` notation.
- ID Selector: Targets a unique element with a specific ID attribute, using the `#idname` notation.
- Descendant Selector: Targets elements that are descendants of another element, using a space between the selectors.

## CSS Properties and Values

CSS properties define the specific aspects of an element you want to style, such as color, font size, or margin. Each property can take one or more values, separated by a colon (`:`). Here are a few common CSS properties:

- `color`: Sets the color of the text.
- `font-size`: Sets the size of the font.
- `margin`: Sets the outer margin of an element.
- `padding`: Sets the inner spacing of an element.
- `background-color`: Sets the background color of an element.
- `border`: Sets the border properties, such as width, style, and color.

## Applying CSS Styles

There are multiple ways to apply CSS styles to your HTML document:

1. Inline Styles: Apply styles directly to individual HTML elements using the `style` attribute.
2. Internal Stylesheet: Define styles within the `<style>` tags in the `<head> `section of your HTML document.
3. External Stylesheet: Link an external CSS file to your HTML document using the `<link> `tag.
